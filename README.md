Food Scanner Application – Barcode Scanning with Health Rating
Overview:
The Food Scanner application allows users to scan product barcodes using their mobile device or a barcode scanner, retrieving detailed product information along with health ratings. This innovative solution leverages Spring Boot (Java) for backend development and integrates the Groq API for processing product data and generating health ratings.

Features:
Barcode Scanning:

The application uses barcode scanning technology to automatically detect and fetch product details when a barcode is scanned.
Users can simply scan the barcode of any product, and the system fetches relevant product details like the name, ingredients, and manufacturer, making the user experience seamless and fast.
Health Rating Integration:

The Groq API is used at the backend to process and evaluate the nutritional data of scanned products.
The system provides a health rating for each product, helping users make informed decisions about the products they consume based on their nutritional value.
Backend Development:

Built with Spring Boot framework to ensure scalable and reliable backend performance. Spring Boot offers a clean and powerful framework for handling APIs, data integration, and ensuring robust operation under different loads.
Integrated all the required dependencies to make the system work efficiently, ensuring fast response times and minimal downtime.
How It Works:
Users scan a product's barcode.
The system queries the product’s information from an integrated database or external API.
The Groq API processes the data, evaluating the product’s health aspects based on its ingredients and nutritional information.
A health rating is generated and displayed to the user.
Technologies Used:
Spring Boot (Java): The main framework for developing the backend services.
Groq API: A powerful API for evaluating and rating the nutritional value of scanned products.
Barcode Scanning: Integrated functionality for automatic product information retrieval.
